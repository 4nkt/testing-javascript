# Testing Node

👋 hi there! This is a workshop repo to learn how to test your Node.js Apps!

## Outline

Here are the topics we'll be covering:

- Testing Pure Functions
- Testing Middleware
- Testing Controllers
- Testing API routes
- Mocking third party dependencies
- Testing authenticated code

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] v10 or greater
- [yarn][yarn] v1 or greater (or [npm][npm] v6 or greater)

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
yarn --version # or npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or [mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup

After you've made sure to have the correct things (and versions) installed, you
should be able to just run the following command to get set up:

```shell
npm install
```

You can verify the setup is complete by starting the server `npm start`

## Running the tests

```shell
npm test
```

This will start [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest) in watch mode. Read the
output and play around with it.

**Your goal will be to go into each test, swap the final version for the
exercise version in the import, and make the tests pass**
