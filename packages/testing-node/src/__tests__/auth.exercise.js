  // for a little extra credit 💯 you can try using `expect.any(String)`
  // (an asymmetric matcher) with toEqual.

  // login
  // 🐨 use axios.post to post the username and password again, but to the login endpoint
  // 💰 http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login
  //
  // 🐨 assert that the result you get back is correct
  // 💰 tip: the data you get back is exactly the same as the data you get back
  // from the registration call, so this can be done really easily by comparing
  // the data of those results with toEqual
  //
  // authenticated request
  // 🐨 use axios.get(url, config) to GET the user's information
  // 💰 http://localhost:8000/api/auth/me
  // 💰 This request must be authenticated via the Authorization header which
  // you can add to the config object: {headers: {Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`}}
  // Remember that you have the token from the registration and login requests.
  //
  // 🐨 assert that the result you get back is correct
  // 💰 (again, this should be the same data you get back in the other requests,
  // so you can compare it with that).
